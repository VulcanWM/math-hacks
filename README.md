# mathhacks

## what this does
it's a website where every 2 weeks there is a hackathon related to a maths related theme, it's for teens looking to get more creative about maths.

## why i made it
i like hackathons and i like maths. so i decided to combine the two together and host some events.

## how i made it
i used next.js with tailwind, shadcn and mongodb

## what i struggled with and what i learnt
i decided to use more strict mongoose schemas, it was very hard to implement at first but now it feels more secure and i don't need to do multiple checks.
